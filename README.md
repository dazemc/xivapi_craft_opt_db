# xivapi_craft_opt_db
xivapi calls for ffxiv crafting optimizer database files 

This is done. I've learned a lot from when I started this and would do it differently now. 
I'm not so sure about this OOP thing but I can see how it's useful for large projects. 

This is aimed to assist https://github.com/NotRanged/NotRanged.github.io in producing db files. 
But is mainly a personal gauge of my progress learning python.
